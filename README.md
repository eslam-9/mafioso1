# Mafioso 🕵️‍♂️🎭

**Mafioso** is a modern, AI-powered reimagining of the classic social deduction party game "Mafia" (also known as Werewolf). 

Gone are the days of needing a human moderator to sit out the fun. Mafioso uses **Google Gemini AI** to act as an infinite, dynamic Narrator, cultivating unique and immersive stories for every single game session.
